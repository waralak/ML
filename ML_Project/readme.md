# Final Project for Machine Learning Course 2022

This repo is for uploading files for my work. We reproduced two algorithms: Sudarut's SMOTEBoost and my AdaFair. Iosifidis and Ntoutsi's Adafair algorithm was replicated and evaluated with four datasets: adult income dataset, bank dataset, COMPAS dataset, and KDD Census income dataset.
