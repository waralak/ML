# Final Project for Machine Learning Course 2022
This repo is for uploading some files as part of my work. The Adafair Algorithm proposed by [(Iosifidis & Ntoutsi, 2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08982.pdf) was reproduced and tested with 4 datasets: [Adult Income Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income), [Bank Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prakharrathi25/banking-dataset-marketing-targets?select=train.csv), [COMPAS dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/propublica/compas-analysis/master/compas-scores-two-years.csv), [KDD Census income dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census-Income+(KDD)).
